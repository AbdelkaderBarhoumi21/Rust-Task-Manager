# Rust Task Manager

A simple command-line task manager written in Rust. This program allows you to add, view, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks from a storage. It makes use of Rust's powerful ownership model, error handling with `Result`, and the `HashMap` for storing tasks.

## Features

- 📥 **Add Task**: Add a new task by providing a title and description.
- 📝 **View Tasks**: View all tasks stored with their ID, title, description, and status.
- ✅ **Mark Task as Completed**: Change the task's status from "Pending" or "InProgress" to "Completed".
- ❌ **Delete Task**: Remove a task from the storage by its ID.
- 🚪 **Exit**: Exit the task manager.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed. If not, install it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
